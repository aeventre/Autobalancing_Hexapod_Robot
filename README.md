## Overview
The primary goal of this project was to design a Hexapod Robot capable of performing dynamic movements and maintaining self-balance. The robot demonstrates the integration of mechanical and electronic systems and software packages to achieve autonomous and stable locomotion. The hexapod robot features a Raspberry Pi 4b as the central processing unit. It relies on ROS 2 Jazzy to manage the communication and control across the robot's various components. Each package communication ensures continuous data exchange between the packages for dynamic adjustments. The key objectives of the hexapod include the following: 

1. Ensuring the robot can walk and move dynamically.
2. Incorporating real-time balancing mechanisms to keep the robot functional and upright under various conditions.
3. Develop modular software packages for control, movement computation, and sensing.
4. Utilize ROS 2 Jazzy to coordinate the robot's operations.

### Future Goals
1. Developing the kinematic algorithms further to advance the robot's movement.
2. Integrating a LIDAR sensor that would assist the robot in navigating its surroundings by providing object perception.
3. Implementing wireless communication for remote control and monitoring.
4. Experimenting with new gait patterns for improved efficiency and adaptability.
