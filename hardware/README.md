# Hardware Design

## Structure
All CAD models currently being used are from "Robs Tech Workbench" and can be found at https://github.com/robs-tech-workbench/hexapod_spiderbot_model\  

Since this project is using slightly different hardware to his, some parts of the central body will eventually be modified and that CAD will be uploaded here.

## Electronics

For this project a custom PCB was designed to rest on top of a Raspberry pi 4b in order to make the wiring for everything neater and because PCB design is fun.
